##  Assets requirements for media kit

### Assets Requests from Developers
-   The assets you provide us with be used to ensure the landing pages and marketing materials we make are as on-brand as they can be.
-   This will result in landing pages that don't only look  cool and professional, but also convert better. Higher install rates help making the most out of every marketing dollar you invest.  
-   We will never use your assets for anything other than promoting your brand without your consent.
-   Here is an example of a landing page we created for partners:

## What we need
### App’s Design System On Figma
-   If possible, we would prefer getting the full app's design system in whatever form you have. 
-   The next slides are a checklist of what we will need from your DS. 
-   Best format would be Figma.

### 1.  Logo
 -   Preferably in SVG format.
 -   Please provide all approved variations of the logo.
 -   If there is no option for SVG format, please provide the logo in a high resolution PNG file with no added background.
